* TODO ("unknown type" (Const(Builtin FUNC))) :bug:
  this is an error in 'types - hello world' and is some fundamental issue with typing.
  Basically,

  1. ~Func~ is a type so ~typeof(Func)~ should be  ..? -> ? -> Resolvedfunction~
     Func[...TParams][TReturn] -> ~ResolvedFunction~ 

  2. List is a type constructor, Int is a type. List[Int] is a type
  3.
